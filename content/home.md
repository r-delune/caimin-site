Welcome to **My Profile**.

In this section, we will ask you some questions about your experiences with drug use.

In this context, "drugs" means any substance which **was not prescribed for you** and **was not for medicinal purposes**.

As you respond to these questions, we would like you **not to think of alcohol, nicotine or caffeine** as drugs.

Any information you provide here is completely confidential, and will not be shared with anyone outside of MyUSE.
