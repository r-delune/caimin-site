Ollphéist brings the tradition of storytelling into the digital world, facilitating new interpretations of our folklore through GIFs. What is the potential of everyday technologies to tell stories? How might oral cultures be imagined in visual form? These are questions we asked during a series of creative workshops led by folklorist Billy Mag Fhloinn and designer Hugh Heffernan, as well as through an open call to Irish and international artists. From 30 October to 6 November, an exhibition of GIFs will be displayed from sunset to sunrise in the windows of local businesses.

​

The exhibiting artists are Alexia Achilleos, Anna Gormley, Anonymous, Ashlee Hassett, Brendan Egan, Caoimhe Dalton, Denise Kehoe, Isolde Buí, Jessica Mackey, Lucy McKenna, John Lillis, Mankyy Murdoch, María del Buey, Michiel Teeuw, Sam Windrim, Seán McGuill, Tadgh Flynn, and Tadgh Ó Cuirrín. For those living outside the 5km radius of Limerick City Centre, the artists’ work will be published on our instagram page @OrmstonHouse throughout level 5 restrictions from the Plan for Living with COVID-19.

​

Ollphéist (transl. Fabulous Beasts) is curated by Caimin Walsh. The project is funded by Creative Ireland and Limerick City & County Council through a Creative Ireland: Made in Limerick grant.
