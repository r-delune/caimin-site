The **Museum of Mythological Water Beasts (2017–)** is a multi-year project bringing together artists and communities to learn about the River Shannon. 

In 2021, a programme of __River Residencies__ will connect artists with rural communities who live and work along the river in Cavan, Clare, Limerick and Tipperary, to create new artistic projects. The River Residencies are a collaborative initiative led by Limerick Culture and Arts Office and Ormston House in partnership with Cavan Arts Office, Clare Arts Office and Tipperary Arts Office, co-funded by the Arts Council of Ireland through An Invitation to Collaboration. The River Residencies are co-curated by Caimin Walsh and Mary Conlon from Ormston House.
