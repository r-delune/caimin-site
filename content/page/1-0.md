The Museum of Mythological Water Beasts (2017–) is a multi-year project bringing together artists and communities to learn about the River Shannon. In 2021, a programme of River Residencies will connect artists with rural communities who live and work along the river in Cavan, Clare, Limerick and Tipperary, to create new artistic projects. The River Residencies are a collaborative initiative led by Limerick Culture and Arts Office and Ormston House in partnership with Cavan Arts Office, Clare Arts Office and Tipperary Arts Office, co-funded by the Arts Council of Ireland through An Invitation to Collaboration. The River Residencies are co-curated by Caimin Walsh and Mary Conlon from Ormston House.
